        <p>
            Entchant-scrollbar is a plugin to customize or to create scrollbars for your web applications. The motivation behind this is that each platform, operating system or browser has their own scrollbars and sometime it causes an issue with your design. For example, windows decrease the browser window’s size to add the scrollbar while mac by default hide the scrolls bar and shows it only when scrolling, but you can’t drag it. By using this plugin you can add a cross platform design and personalize it. Image or GIF example
