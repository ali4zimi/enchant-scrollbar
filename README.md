# Enchant Scrollbar

The scrollbar of your web application doesn't look the same on different platforms. This is because the scrollbar is a native component of the browser. This package allows you to create a custom scrollbar that looks the same on all platforms. Also, this package allows you to create a custom scrollbar for the element with the overflow property set to hidden.

## Installation

You can install this package via npm:

```bash
npm install enchant-scrollbar
```
